## The application was built to connect to google cloud platform database, and perform data processing to the StackOverflow dataset, which merged the posts id dataset and the posts rating dataset, and sorted the merged dataset in a descending order. The output is the top five posts that have the highest rating.

## The top five posts information can be shown through /topfive command in the url of fast api application.

## Calculator funciton

## Through type in the numbers and operation symbol in the url, the api will return the result in the REST interface. It currently only allows simple calculations(addition, substraction, multiplication and division). 
### * For the division operation, the user will need to use 'd' instead of '/' as operation symbol.

## The api will also handle some basic errors, such as divisor being zero, and invalid operational symbol
